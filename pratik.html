            <p> The person leading the U.S. response to the <a href="#">coronavirus outbreak </a>, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. 
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause 
                “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social gatherings are discouraged.

                That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a known source of exposure — are
                now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

                “We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”
